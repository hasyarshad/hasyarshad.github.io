## Research Interests

**Having done Electrical Engineering with major in ‘Control Engineering’,** my main research focus is on power electronics, nonlinear dynamical systems, 
variable speed drives for multiphase induction motor, digital filter design and flatness based robust control of nonlinear systems. I'm also interested in exploring the 
pros of using sequential learning algorithms with Extreme Learning Machines for real-time industrial automation. Recently, I have started exploring Condition 
Monitoring System for battery packs using current density images of Li-ion cells using chaotic magnometric sensor arrangement.
**If you are interested in working with me,** please send me an [email](mailto:{{site.email}}). 
I'd love to discuss further on topics related to above-mentioned broader research areas through online video-conferencing platforms e.g. Zoom, Skype etc.
