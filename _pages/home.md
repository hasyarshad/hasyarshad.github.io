## Welcome!

#### `$ whoami`

Hi! I’m **M. Haseeb**, a control engineer and an enthusiastic programmer, previously enrolled in the 
<a href="http://www.kfupm.edu.sa/departments/ee/default.aspx" target="_blank">Department of Electrical Engineering</a> 
at King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Saudi Arabia as a full time graduate student.

I have worked with <a href="https://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/ee/mabido/" target="_blank">Distinguished Professor Mohammed Ali Abido </a> 
at the FACTS LAB on improvement of model predictive control for industrial drives. Most of my research work is focused on Machine Drives 
and Multilevel Inverters. I’ve published several journal & proceeding papers on the improvement of Two-Phase Symmetrical Induction Motor Drive 
and Finite Set Control Model Predictive Torque Control of Induction Motor. 

I have also worked with <a href="https://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/EE/mkassas/" target="_blank">Associate Professor Mahmoud Kassas</a> 
at KFUPM for the study of chaos in Power Electronics. Recently I’ve started exploring the usefulness of machine learning in industrial drives and smart grids.

I study topics including stochastic theory, advanced power electronic, convex optimization theory, evolutionary programming, adaptive control, 
digital signal processing, machine learning, introduction to fundamentals and intelligent control. As today’s world is increasingly made possible 
through verification of software simulations, my work also is more focused towards the experimental validation of the proposed design simulations.

I previously received my M.Sc from <a href="https://www.uet.edu.pk/faculties/facultiesinfo/department?RID=introduction&id=9" target="_blank">Department of Electrical Engineering </a> 
at University of Engineering & Technology - Lahore, where I worked with <a href="https://www.uet.edu.pk/faculties/facultiesinfo/ee/DrKhalidMahmood.html" target="_blank">Professor Khalid Mehmood-ul-Hassan</a>, 
and my B.Sc. from <a href="http://pu.edu.pk/home/subdepartment/67003" target="_blank">Department of Electrical Engineering </a> at University of the Punjab, Lahore. 

I consider myself an inter-disciplinary nomad, working in disciplines like computer science, information science, electrical engineering, and management science.
