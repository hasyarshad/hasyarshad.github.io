  abstract = {In this paper, a modified direct torque control (DTC) method for four-switch two-leg inverter, also known as B4 inverter, fed two-phase symmetrical induction motor is proposed. The presented technique shows a prospect of developing a similar DTC strategy of six-switch fed three-leg three-phase induction motor by emulation. With the help of suitable combinations of active intrinsic vectors of B4 inverter, enhanced torque dynamics as well as considerable reduction in torque ripple is achieved. Simulation results confirm the high performance of the proposed technique, which ultimately can very effectively be employed in automotive industry.}

  abstract = {Based on chaos theory, a hybrid space vector pulse width modulation, Chaotic SVPWM, is proposed. The conventional SVPWM contains harmonic components with higher amplitudes around the switching frequency (fixed) whereas the proposed chaotic SVPWM is operated at chaotic period of the inverter thereby varying the switching frequency for the inverter. Because of this varying switching frequency, the peak value of harmonics got distributed over the output harmonics spectrum of the inverter, effectively suppressing the influence of harmonics and ultimately reducing the current/torque ripple of the induction motor. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is cost efficient, straightforward and can be used to suppress EMI characteristics of the inverter. The design methodology is based on a two-phase power system, but it can easily be extended for n-phase systems as well. The simulation is performed in MATLAB to validate this C-SVPWM control technique.}

  abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) is the result of the latest advances in power electronics and modem control. It is regarded as one of the best techniques when it comes to handling of nonlinearities in the intrinsic model of induction motor (IM). Conventional MPC utilizes weighting factors in the objective function that are tuned after rigorous experimental work which can be improved by utilizing the more mature intelligent optimization techniques like NSGA-II etc. In this study, the weighting factor optimization for the conventional MPC control of IM based on NSGA-II with TOPSIS decision-making criteria is studied. A control algorithm is designed, and an experimental test setup is made to obtain the results of this intelligent MPC which are compared with conventional MPC based on some performance indices like torque and flux ripple, switching frequency loss etc.}

An Overview of Sequential Learning Algorithms for Single Hidden Layer Networks: Current Issues & Future Trends. Abstract: In this paper, a brief survey of the commonly used sequential-learning algorithms used with single hidden layer feed-forward neural networks is presented. A glimpse at the different kinds that are available in the literature up until now, how they have developed throughout the years, and their relative execution is summarized. Most important things to take note of during the designing phase of neural networks are its complexity, computational efficiency, maximum training time, and ability to generalize the under-study problem. The comparison of different sequential learning algorithms in regard to these merits for single hidden layer neural networks is drawn.}

  abstract = {In this paper, an artificial bee colony optimized self-tuning proportional integrator (PI) regulator is proposed for the finite control set model predictive current control (FCS-MPCC) of the permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). In view of the MIT rule hypothesis, the self-tuning laws were defined. The optimized coefficients for the PI regulator were calculated using a custom defined objective function for artificial bee colony algorithm to manage external (load) and internal disturbances. The proposed self-tuning PI controller with optimized coefficients result in smaller steady state torque bias error with improved dynamic speed response especially during the speed reversal. Furthermore, the self-tuning laws are extremely basic and can be easily implemented. Numerical simulations were carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed speed controller and comparison was drawn with the classical PI under the same test in the MATLAB/Simulink environment.}

  abstract = {Over the past decade, chaotic systems have found their immense application in different fields, which has led to various generalized, novel, and modified chaotic systems. In this paper, the general jerk equation is combined with a scaled sine map, which has been approximated in terms of a polynomial using Taylor series expansion for exhibiting chaotic behavior. The paper is based on numerical simulation and experimental verification of the system with four control parameters. The proposed system’s chaotic behavior is verified by calculating different chaotic invariants using MATLAB, such as bifurcation diagram, 2-D attractor, Fourier spectra, correlation dimension, and Maximum Lyapunov Exponent. Experimental verification of the system was carried out using Op-Amps with analog multipliers.}

  year={2021},
  publisher={Springer Berlin Heidelberg},
  abstract = {This paper proposes a hierarchical control law for DC motor fed by DC–DC power Cuk Converter. The control is divided into two parts: Firstly, the property of differential flatness associated with the mathematical model of the DC motor is studied to design a robust control that achieves the task of tracking the reference angular speed trajectory for the motor. It also gives the voltage profile ϑ which must be followed by the Cuk converter. The second independent controller, based on cascade control, is proposed for the Cuk converter, which allows the converter output voltage to follow the specified trajectory ϑ. Sliding mode control is used in the inner loop, whereas proportional integral control is used in the proposed cascade controller’s outer loop. Numerical simulation of the hierarchical control technique is carried out in MATLAB/Simulink, and results under parametric variation show robustness. Finally, a comparison is drawn for speed trajectory tracking by the DC motor coupled with DC–DC buck and Cuk converter to show the performance improvement in case of using Cuk converter for angular speed trajectory tacking of a DC motor.}
